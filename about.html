      <p class="photo-description" style="float:right;width:40%;">This is Rebecca's first time facilitating a Girls Who Code club.  While there have been many challenges, she is happy to say that she has enjoyed her time with the girls and has learned a bit of html/css in the process!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container" style="width:100%;">
      <img class="photo" style="float:left;width:25%;" src="daniellebio.jpg">
      <p class="photo-description" style="float:right;width:40%;">This is Danielle's first time with Girls Who Code. She came every week except for the last week (which she spent at a Lindsey Stirling concert, and Rebecca is still quite jealous of this), and she always brought with her an infectious enthusiasm for everything from coding to dance and music, as is shown in her chosen bio pic. She had previous experience with Scratch, but this is her first time creating with Codesters.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container" style="width:100%;">
      <img class="photo" style="float:left;width:25%;" src="avabio.jpg">
      <p class="photo-description" style="float:right;width:40%;">This is Ava's first time with Girls Who Code. Similar to Danielle, she had prior experience with Scratch and has made a variety of projects on that platform for fun, but this was her first time with Codesters. She has an intuitive grasp of this style of coding, as can be seen in her project, and she was always willing to help other girls when they had trouble.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container" style="width:100%;">
      <img class="photo" style="float:left;width:25%;" src="saachibio.jpg">
      <p class="photo-description" style="float:right;width:40%;">This is Saachi's first time with Girls Who Code. While she had a rough start picking up the coding concepts, she worked really hard both during the sessions and at home and improved drastically by the end - so much so that she had the longest project of the girls working with Codesters (242 lines!).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container" style="width:100%;">
      <img class="photo" style="float:left;width:25%;" src="abbybio.jpg">
      <p class="photo-description" style="float:right;width:40%;">This is Abby's first time with Girls Who Code. Bright and talented, she knew immediately that she wanted to work on something of a higher level, and so she took on the challenge of learning html/css and co-coded the website alongside Saanvi with a bit of help from her ever-eager facilitator.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container" style="width:100%;">
      <img class="photo" style="float:left;width:25%;" src="saanvibio.jpg">
      <p class="photo-description" style="float:right;width:40%;">This is Saanvi's first time with Girls Who Code. Ambitious and intelligent, she is a girl of many talents, from dancing to coding. When she heard there was a possibility to learn how to code the website, she immediately jumped onto the project with Abby and Rebecca.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container" style="width:100%;">
      <img class="photo" style="float:left;width:25%;" src="trinitybio.jpg">
      <p class="photo-description" style="float:right;width:40%;">This is Trinity's first time with Girls Who Code. She brought a unique, artistic, and independent sensibility to each meeting, and she took on the challenge of being the only one in the group to learn how to code music. As you can see from her project, she did a wonderful job and has expressed a desire to continue learning more!</p>
